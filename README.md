- Basic Python Projects 

This repository contains my beginner-level Python projects, created while learning programming fundamentals.

- Projects Included

1. Calculator Project
   A simple calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using `if-else` conditions.

2. Guessing Game Project
   A number guessing game using `random` and `while` loops. The program picks a number and the user has to guess it!

* What I Learned
- `if-else` statements
- Looping (`for`, `while`)
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Importing modules like `random`
- User input and condition handling
